# Pulling in upstream work

Upstream is [storytold/gridcraft](https://github.com/storytold/gridcraft). We merge its `main`
into ours; our changes stay a thin layer on top (`docs/brand.md`).

```bash
scripts/sync-upstream.sh            # fetch upstream, merge into a branch, run the checks
```

The script adds the `upstream` remote if it is missing, creates `sync/upstream-<date>` from
`main`, merges `upstream/main`, and leaves the checks to you (`cargo xtask ci`). Open a pull
request from that branch; `main` is protected and is only changed through pull requests.

Conflicts come from the files the brand layer touches. `NOTICE` keeps our version automatically
(`.gitattributes` marks it `merge=ours`; the script enables that merge driver). `README.md` is
our header on top of upstream's feature sections, so upstream README edits merge in below the
line; if the header conflicts, keep ours. For anything else, keep upstream's logic and re-apply
the rename.

CI here is upstream's. Upstream has no test workflow on pull requests: run `cargo xtask ci` locally.
Packaging lint runs on pull requests that touch packaging, workflows or the app icon; FreeBSD runs
only when started by hand; Windows ARM64 runs on a push to a `release` branch or by hand. The
Flatpak Pages workflow publishes only when a GitHub release is published (its page titles still
say GridCraft; they are for the packaging pass). Turned off in this repository, on purpose (it
costs Actions minutes and builds things we do not ship yet): `release.yml`. Turn it on from the
Actions tab when it is wanted.
